# VimeoNetworking

**VimeoNetworking** is the authoritative Swift networking library for the Vimeo API.  Fully designed and implemented with Swift in mind, **VimeoNetworking** is type-safe, well `enum`erated, and never, ever, *ever* force-unwrapped. 

##### Hey Creator, if you're primarily interested in uploading videos to Vimeo, you should check out [VimeoUpload](https://github.com/vimeo/VimeoUpload) too.

## Installing with CocoaPods

To get started integrating `VimeoNetworking`, add the following lines to your `Podfile` and run `pod install`:

```Ruby
use_frameworks! # required for Swift frameworks

target 'YourAppTargetName' do
	pod 'VimeoNetworking', '1.0'
end
```

## Initialization

The first step towards using the Vimeo API is registering a new application on the Vimeo Developer site: [My API Apps](https://developer.vimeo.com/apps).  You'll need a Vimeo account, if you don't already have one.

### App Configuration

Once you have a new app setup, click into its authentication settings and make note of the "Client Identifier" and "Client Secret" fields.  Next, determine which `Scope` permissions your application requires from the available options listed here: [Supported Scopes](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/authentication#scopes).  Use this information to instantiate a new `AppConfiguration` value:

```Swift
let appConfiguration = AppConfiguration(
		clientIdentifier: "Your client identifier goes here",
		clientSecret: "Your client secret goes here",
		scope: [.Public, .Private, .Interact])
```

### Client

To interact with the Vimeo API, we use a `VimeoClient` instance.  The client is the primary interface of **VimeoNetworking**, it takes care of executing requests, cache storage and retrieval, tracking the current authenticated account, and handling global error conditions.  You can instantiate one with the application configuration you created a moment ago.

```Swift
let vimeoClient = VimeoClient(configuration: appConfiguration)
```

But before we can actually start getting data from the API, there's one last step. All calls to the Vimeo API must be authenticated, but `VimeoNetworking` makes that simple too, read on:

## Authenticating

`AuthenticationController` handles the process of authenticating with the Vimeo API.  It uses the configuration of an associated `VimeoClient` to make requests. On successful authentication, it passes the new Vimeo account back to this client, and that client can then make requests to API endpoints.

### Client Credentials

Client credentials allow you to see everything that's publicly available on Vimeo.  This is essentially equivalent to visiting Vimeo.com without signing up for an account or logging in.  This is the simplest authentication method to implement.

```Swift 
let authenticationController = AuthenticationController(client: vimeoClient)

authenticationController.clientCredentialsGrant { result in 
	switch result {
	case .Success(let account):
		print("Successfully authenticated with account: \(account)")
	case .Failure(let error):
		print("error authenticating: \(error)")	
	}
}
```

### Code Grant

If you want to log in as a user, the Vimeo API provides a process called Code Grant authentication.  Your app launches a specific URL in Safari, the user signs up or logs in on Vimeo.com, then control is redirected back to your application where authentication completes.

To prepare your application to receive this redirect, navigate to your app target settings > Info > URL Types.  Add a new URL Type, and under url scheme enter `vimeo` followed by your client identifier (for example, if your client identifier is `1234`, enter `vimeo1234`).  This allows Vimeo to redirect back into your app after authorization.  You also need to add this redirect URL to your app on the Vimeo API site.  Under “App Callback URL”, add `vimeo{CLIENT_KEY}://auth` (for the example above, `vimeo1234://auth`).

Now, in an appropriate place in your app, open the code grant authorization URL in Safari:

```Swift
let authenticationController = AuthenticationController(client: vimeoClient)

let URL = authenticationController.codeGrantAuthorizationURL()
UIApplication.sharedApplication.openURL(URL)
```

The user will prompted to grant permissions to your application.  When they accept, your redirect URL will be opened, which will reopen your application.  Handle this event in your application delegate:

```Swift
func application(app: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL, options: [String : AnyObject]) -> Bool
    {
        authenticationController.codeGrant(responseURL: url) { result in
            switch result {
            case .Success(let account):
                print("authenticated successfully: \(account)")
            case .Failure(let error):
                print("failure authenticating: \(error)")
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
```

### Saved Accounts

`AuthenticationController` saves the accounts it authenticates in the Keychain.  The next time your application opens, you should first attempt to load a previously authenticated account before prompting the user to authenticate again.

```Swift
do {
	if let account = try authenticationController.loadSavedAccount() {
		print("account loaded successfully: \(account)"
	} else {
		print("no saved account found, authenticate...")
	}
}
catch let error {
	print("error loading account: \(error)")
}
```

## Interacting with Vimeo

You're initialized, you're configured, you're authenticated.  Now  you're ready to rock!  Awesome, let's actually start hitting some endpoints. 🤘🤘

### Making Requests

We represent each interaction with the Vimeo API as an instance of `Request`.  Each one holds its own understanding of HTTP method, URL path, parameters (if any), expected model object type, caching behavior, and (if desired) retry-after-failure behavior.  That's a lot to grasp up front, so let's step back and look at the simplest request we can make:

```Swift
let videoRequest = Request<VIMVideo>(path: "/videos/45196609")
```

There are two critical takeaways here:
- `<VIMVideo>`: the generic type of the model object.  This is what request will return in the `Response` if it's successful.
- `path: "..."`: the API endpoint we want to call, you can see a whole host of other options at [Vimeo API Endpoints](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/endpoints)

By declaring the expected model object type, we can ensure that the both the request and the parsing of the JSON is successful, and we can guarantee that our `Response` precisely matches this expectation.  All potential Vimeo models are already implemented in **VimeoNetworking**, and they're available for use in your own implementation.  Model classes are all named with the `VIM` suffix: `VIMUser`, `VIMChannel`, `VIMCategory`, and so on.

### Handling Responses

After we send that response, we'll get a `Result` enum back.  This could be either a `.Success` or a `.Failure` value.  `.Success` will contain a `Response` object, while `.Failure` will contain an `NSError`.  Switch between these two cases to handle whichever is encountered:

```Swift
vimeoClient.request(videoRequest) { result in 
	switch result {
	case .Success(let response: Response):
		let video: VIMVideo = response.model
		print("retrieved video: \(video)")
	case .Failure(let error: NSError):
		print("error retrieving video: \(error)"
	}
}
```


### Collections

One neat **ProTip**: arrays of model objects are also valid generic types of `Request`.  In this case, the `model` property of your `Response` will be an array of parsed models of the expected type.

```Swift
let staffPickedVideosRequest = Request<[VIMVideo]>(path: "/channels/staffpicks/videos")

vimeoClient.request(staffPickedVideosRequest) { result in 
	switch result {
	case .Success(let response: Response):
		let videos: [VIMVideo] = response.model
		for video in videos {
			print("retrieved video: \(video)")
		}
	case .Failure(let error: NSError):
		print("error retrieving videos: \(error)"
	}
}
```


## Last remarks

With *all that* said, you now have a pretty solid picture of what **VimeoNetworking** can do.  There's always more to explore, and we encourage you to play with the sample project, or dive right into the code and try it out yourself.  Most of our classes and functions are decently documented in the source files, so more detail on any topic can be found there.  If you still have questions or you're running into trouble, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/vimeo/VimeoNetworking/issues).  Better yet, if you fixed an issue or you have an improvement you'd like to share, send us a [pull request](https://github.com/vimeo/VimeoNetworking/pulls).
